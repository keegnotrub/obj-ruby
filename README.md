A fork of [GNUstep's RIGS](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-ruby), updated for modern verions of macOS and Ruby.

   where "myapp" is the application name.

3. Change directory to `myapp` and start the app:

        $ cd myapp

## Credit

ObjRuby is a fork of [GNUstep's RIGS](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-ruby), which according to it's author/maintainer [Laurent Julliard](https://github.com/ljulliar):

>  was built in my spare time when my 3 children are in bed :-)

It's really a testimate to both Laurent and the Objective-C runtime in general that while much of the original code was written in 2001, an incredible amount of it runs unchanged over 20 years later on modern versions of macOS and Ruby.
